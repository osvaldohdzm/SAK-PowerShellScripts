    .SYNOPSIS
    Outputs to a UTF-8-encoded file *without a BOM* (byte-order mark).

    .DESCRIPTION
    Mimics the most important aspects of Out-File:
    * Input objects are sent to Out-String first.
    * - Append allows you to append to an existing file, -NoClobber prevents
        overwriting of an existing file.
    * - Width allows you to specify the line width for the text representations
        of input objects that aren't strings.
    However, it is not a complete implementation of all Out-String parameters:
    * Only a literal output path is supported, and only as a parameter.
    * -Force is not supported.

    Caveat: *All* pipeline input is buffered before writing output starts,
            but the string representations are generated and written to the target
            file one by one.

    .NOTES
    The raison d'Ãªtre for this advanced function is that, as of PowerShell v5,
    Out-File still lacks the ability to write UTF-8 files without a BOM:
    using -Encoding UTF8 invariably prepends a BOM.
